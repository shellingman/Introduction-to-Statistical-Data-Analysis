## Example 1 from slides

Identify the sample spaces for the following experiments:

- Flipping two fair coins
- Rolling a six sided die.
- Rolling one fair coin and one six sided die.



## Example 2 from slides

following events:

- Flipping two fair coins and both resulting in heads.
- Landing on a 5 when rolling a six sided die.
- Rolling one fair coin and one six sided die and landing on a heads and five
