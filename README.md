## Course Information

### Calendar Description
This course offers a comprehensive overview of data analysis and statistics, with practical applications for each concept. Topics include probability theory, the influence of data collection on analysis, methods of inference including estimation and hypothesis testing, and the fundamentals of regression analysis. Emphasis is placed on modern computational techniques over traditional methods.

### Educational Objectives
Upon completion of the course the students will be expected to:
1. Apply statistical techniques to extract useful information from data.
2. Develop data samples and make estimations.
3. Use probability theories to support decision-making processes.
4. Evaluate hypothesis and make meaningful statistical inferences from data.
5. Apply basic regression techniques to analyse data.
